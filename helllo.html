      <h2>Teens and drugs.</h2>
      Illegal drugs aren't good for anyone, but they are particularly bad for a kid or teen whose body is still growing. Illegal drugs can damage the brain, heart, and other important organs. Cocaine, for instance, can cause a heart attack - even in a kid or teen.

      Sometimes kids and teens try drugs to fit in with a group of friends. Or they might be curious or just bored. Someone may use illegal drugs for many reasons, but often because they help the person escape from reality for a while. A drug might - temporarily - make someone who is sad or upset feel better or forget about problems. But this escape lasts only until the drug wears off.

      <h1>How can we stop them?</h1>
      1. Know your teen activities
Pay close attention to where your teen hangs out with their friends. Discover what type of activities your teen is interested in and help encourage them to get involved.<br>

2. Know who your teen friends are
If the people your teen considers as friends use illegal substances or drink while underage, your child may feel pressure to experiment as well.
<br>
3. Establish ground rules and enforce consequences
Educate your child on your family rules and expectations for one another. Remind them not to ride in a vehicle where there may be an intoxicated driver, or leave a party where drug use occurs. If your rules are broken, enforce appropriate consequences.<br>

4. Talk to your teen
Yes, it can be that simple. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) states that when parents do talk to their kids about alcohol or drug use while simultaneously educating them with facts about substance abuse, their children are 400% less likely to abuse substances later in life.
<br>

5. Keep track of prescription drugs in the home
Take inventory of all prescriptions and over-the-counter medications throughout your home and keep them in a safe place.<br>
